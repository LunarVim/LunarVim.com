# Enabling language servers

Neovim comes bundled with a language client but not a language server.
To install a supported language server:

```md
:LspInstall `<your_language_server>`
```

Autocomplete works here. Type `:LspInstall`, then hit `TAB` to see supported language servers

See [LspInstall](https://github.com/kabouzeid/nvim-lspinstall) for more
info.

In order for Java LSP to work, edit `~/.local/share/nvim/lspinstall/java/jdtls.sh` and replace `WORKSPACE="$1"` with `WORKSPACE="$HOME/workspace"`

Most common languages should be supported out of the box, if yours is
not I would welcome a PR

## LSP errors

LunarVim lists the attached lsp server in the bottom status bar. If it
says ‘No client connected’ use :LspInfo to troubleshoot.

### Understanding LspInfo

1.  Make sure there is a client attached to the buffer. 0 attached
    clients means lsp is not running
2.  Active clients are clients in other files you have open
3.  Clients that match the filetype will be listed. If installed with
    :LspInstall `<servername>` the language servers will be installed.
4.  ‘cmd’ must be populated. This is the language server executable. If
    the ‘cmd’ isn’t set or if it’s not executable you won’t be able to
    run the language server.
    - In the example below ‘efm-langserver’ is the name of the binary
      that acts as the langserver. If we run ‘which efm-langserver’ and we
      get a location to the executable, it means the langauge server is
      installed and available globally.
    - If you know the command is installed AND you don’t want to install
      it globally you’ll need to manually set 'cmd' in the language server
      settings.
    - Configurations are stored in ~/.config/nvim/lua/lsp/
      The settings will be stored in a file that matches the name of the language.
      e.g. python-ls.lua
    - ‘identified root’ must also be populated. Most
      language servers require you be inside a git repository for the root
      to be detected. If you don’t want to initialize the directory as a
      git repository, an empty .git/ folder will also work.
5.  Some language servers get set up on a per project basis so you may
    have to reinstall the language server when you move to a different
    project.

### Example configurations

[ ======== LSP NOT running ======== ]

```md
0 client(s) attached to this buffer:

0 active client(s):

Clients that match the filetype python:

Config: efm
cmd: /Users/my-user/.local/share/nvim/lspinstall/efm/efm-langserver
cmd is executable: True
identified root: None
custom handlers:

Config: pyright
cmd: /Users/my-user/.local/share/nvim/lspinstall/python/node_modules/.bin/pyright-langserver --stdio
cmd is executable: True
identified root: None
custom handlers: textDocument/publishDiagnostics
```

---

[ ======== LSP IS running ======== ]

```md
2 client(s) attached to this buffer: pyright, efm

Client: pyright (id 1)
root: /home/my-user/workspace/canary
filetypes: python
cmd: /home/my-user/.local/share/nvim/lspinstall/python/node_modules/.bin/pyright-langserver --stdio

Client: efm (id 2)
root: /home/my-user/workspace/canary
filetypes: lua, python, javascriptreact, javascript, typescript, typescriptreact, sh, html, css, json, yaml, markdown, vue
cmd: /home/my-user/.local/share/nvim/lspinstall/efm/efm-langserver
```

### Last resort

If you still have problems after implementing the above measures, rule
out plugin problems with the following. This reinstalls your plugins and
language servers.

```md
rm -rf ~/.local/share/lunarvim/site
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/lspinstall

# Open neovim and run the following

:PackerSync
:LspInstall python `<-- REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN LANGUAGE`
:LspInstall efm `<-- REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN LANGUAGE`
```
