I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/LunarVim/lunarvim.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
I prefixed the title with one of the following tags:
 - docs: on documentation updates
 - fix: when fixing a functionality (e.g. broken links)
 - feat: for feature addition / improvements (e.g. accessibility improvement)
 - refactor: when moving code without adding any functionality
 - [...] more in the contributing guidelines
example: docs(installation): update install command for windows 

[IMPORTANT]
Our docs are versioned:
- files in `/docs` are for the next version, you most likely want to edit files in this folder
- files in `/versioned-docs` are frozed docs for current and older versions, edits here won't be included in the next version
